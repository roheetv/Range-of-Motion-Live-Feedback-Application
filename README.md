# Range-of-Motion-Live-Feedback-Application
Pose Angle Viewer is a lightweight desktop app for range-of-motion (ROM) measurement and live feedback. Open a video or webcam, select up to five joints (knee, hip, trunk, ankle, shoulder), and see clean on-screen angles with color-coded overlays. When ready, export an annotated MP4 for review, documentation, or client hand-off.
